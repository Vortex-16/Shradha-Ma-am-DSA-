# 🔧 FIXED: Java ClassNotFoundException Issue

## ❌ **Problem:**
```
Error: Could not find or load main class SortingMenu
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: SortingMenu
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 🎯 **Root Cause:**
The batch files were not setting the correct working directory, so Java couldn't find the `.class` files.

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **Main Launcher (DSA-Complete-Hub.bat):**
```batch
:: Added this line after @echo off
cd /d "%~dp0"

:: Changed from:
java -cp . PatternAdvanceMenu
java -cp . SortingMenu

:: To:
java PatternAdvanceMenu
java SortingMenu
```

#### 2. **Executables Directory Files:**
- Updated `PatternAdvance.bat`
- Updated `SortingAlgorithms.bat` 
- Updated `DSA-Programs.bat`

All now include:
```batch
:: Set working directory to script location
cd /d "%~dp0"
```

### 🎉 **Result:**
✅ **All programs now work correctly!**
✅ **No more ClassNotFoundException errors**
✅ **Users can run from any directory**
✅ **Batch files set correct working directory automatically**

### 🚀 **Verification:**
- ✅ Main launcher works
- ✅ Pattern programs work
- ✅ Sorting algorithms work
- ✅ Executables directory works
- ✅ All batch files are fixed

## 💡 **Technical Explanation:**
The `cd /d "%~dp0"` command:
- `%~dp0` = Drive and path of the batch file
- `cd /d` = Change to that drive and directory
- This ensures Java runs from the correct location where .class files exist
