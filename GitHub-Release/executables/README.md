# DSA Programs - Pattern Advanced & Sorting Algorithms

## 🎯 Overview
This package contains executable programs for DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning, specifically focusing on:
- **Pattern Advanced Programs** (9 different pattern types)
- **Sorting Algorithms** (7 different sorting methods)

## 📁 Files in executables/ directory:

### Main Executables:
- **`DSA-Programs.bat`** - 🚀 **MAIN LAUNCHER** (Start here!)
- **`PatternAdvance.bat`** - Pattern programs menu
- **`SortingAlgorithms.bat`** - Sorting algorithms menu

### Supporting Files:
- `PatternAdvanceMenu.jar` - Java archive for patterns
- `SortingMenu.jar` - Java archive for sorting
- `PatternAdvanceMenu.class` - Compiled Java class for patterns  
- `SortingMenu.class` - Compiled Java class for sorting

## 🚀 How to Run:

### Option 1: Main Launcher (Recommended)
1. **Double-click `DSA-Programs.bat`**
2. Choose option 1 for Pattern Programs or option 2 for Sorting Programs
3. The menu will loop until you choose to exit

### Option 2: Direct Access
- Double-click `PatternAdvance.bat` for Pattern programs only
- Double-click `SortingAlgorithms.bat` for Sorting programs only

## 📋 Available Programs:

### Pattern Advanced Programs:
1. **Butterfly Pattern** - Creates butterfly shape with stars
2. **Diamond Pattern** - Creates diamond shape with stars
3. **Floyd's Triangle** - Numbers arranged in triangular pattern
4. **Hollow Rhombus** - Rhombus shape with hollow interior
5. **Hollow Rectangle** - Rectangle with hollow interior
6. **Inverted Half Pyramid** - Inverted triangle of stars
7. **Inverted Rotated Half Pyramid** - Right-aligned inverted triangle
8. **Rhombus Pattern** - Solid rhombus shape
9. **Triangle with 0s and 1s** - Alternating 0 and 1 in triangle

### Sorting Algorithms:
1. **Bubble Sort** - Simple comparison-based sorting
2. **Selection Sort** - Find minimum and place in position
3. **Insertion Sort** - Insert elements in sorted portion
4. **Counting Sort** - Non-comparison based sorting
5. **Quick Sort** - Divide and conquer approach
6. **Merge Sort** - Divide and conquer with merging
7. **Inbuilt Sort** - Java's Arrays.sort() method

## ⚙️ System Requirements:
- **Java** must be installed and available in PATH
- **Windows** operating system
- **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** support

## 🎨 Features:
- ✅ **Menu-driven interface** - Easy navigation
- ✅ **Continuous loop** - Programs restart after completion
- ✅ **Colored terminal** - Enhanced visual experience
- ✅ **Error handling** - Checks for Java installation
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Clear instructions and prompts
- ✅ **Educational** - Shows algorithm steps and results

## 🔄 Program Flow:
1. Launch main program
2. Choose pattern or sorting category
3. Select specific algorithm/pattern
4. Enter required input (array size, pattern size, etc.)
5. View results
6. Option to run again or return to menu
7. Exit when desired

## 💡 Usage Tips:
- **For Patterns**: Enter the number of lines/rows when prompted
- **For Sorting**: First enter array size, then enter array elements
- **To Exit**: Choose exit option from any menu or close terminal window
- **To Restart**: Programs automatically offer restart option

## 🛠️ Technical Details:
- Written in **Java**
- Compiled to `.class` files for faster execution
- Packaged as `.jar` files for portability
- Wrapped in `.bat` files for easy Windows execution
- Menu system keeps programs running until explicit exit

## 📚 Learning Objectives:
- Understand different pattern creation techniques
- Learn various sorting algorithm implementations
- Practice time and space complexity analysis
- Develop algorithmic thinking skills
